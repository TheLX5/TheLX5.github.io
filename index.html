            <h1 id="archipelago">Archipelago Randomizers</h1>
            <p>Archipelago is a system that allows games to be randomized in a multiworld setting. I've done quite a few of those already, feel free to look around them and give them a go :P</p>

                        <h2>SMW: Spicy Mycena Waffles</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Explore SMW with a twist! You've been stripped out of basic abilities which can be learned again by finding items in the multiworld.</p>
                    <p>Make your way into Bowser's hideout and beat him once again... or go into a scavenge hunt for Yoshi Eggs scattered all around Dinosaur Land!</p>
                    <p>This is a fork of the AP SMW Randomizer.</p>

                    <p>Blast across stages finding upgrades in unusual places, some items might even be inside health pickups or even worse, a random Maverick might have those in their filthy hands!</p>
                    <p>There may be other new upgrades from future entries here...</p>

                    <p>Like in the previous adventure, go through stages after finding their coordinates and seek help anywhere you're able to, don't forget to check inside small health pickups!</p>

                    <p>Thinking about it, all three MMX games share the same randomizer design philosophy... so have fun like in X and X2! :D</p>
