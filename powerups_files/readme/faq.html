	<h3><a id="Mariofan64">How can I remove powerups that I have no plans to use?</a></h3><br>
	You can't.<br>
	It's not on my plans to offer such option, at most you can trim down to 1 byte each graphics file you don't want (don't remove them, the patch will whine about it) and call it a day.<br>
	I'm not releasing powerups in an add-on fashion either, that sounds like a lot of effort and I don't wanna waste time on such things.<br><br>

	<h2><a id="Rearrange">Is it possible to rearrange the way the powerups are listed?</a></h2><br>
	This is possible if you know which files are you supposed to change. It is not recommended to do it if you have little to no experience with ASM, you might get confused.<br>
	What you have to do is modify the necessary files in the following folders:<br>
	<ol>
	<li>powerup_main_code</li>
	<li>powerup_image_code</li>
	<li>powerup_interaction_code</li>
	<li>powerup_defs</li>
	<li>powerup_misc_data</li>
	</ol>
	You have to modify a lot of things and it won't be worth the time spent on it, but if you wanna do it, go ahead. Just don't expect much support on tweaking the core files of the patch and expect everything to magically work.<br><br>

	<h3><a id="CustomHUDs">Are custom status bars compatible with this?</a></h3><br>
	No, but I do have plans to update my own custom Sprite Status Bar patch to be compatible with this. I'd like these other patches floating around to support this patch natively rather than offering separate downloads in the release thread.<br>
