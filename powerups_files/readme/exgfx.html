	<h3><a id="#SetUp">Setting up the new graphics</a></h3><br>
	The player graphics format is the same as they are in Ladida's 32x32 player tilemap kit patch, each frame is a 32x32 square in the bin file. I suggest using a file that is already included with the patch to know which poses are which.<br>
	To include your new graphics, you have to put your bin file in the <code>powerups_files/graphics</code> folder. Then open powerup_gfx.asm which is in <code>powerups_files</code> folder and add your graphics file there too using the macros you see in the file.<br>
	Macro for bin files with a size <= 32KiB:<br>
	<code><br>
	%insert_gfx(filename,id)<br>
	</code><br>
	Macro for graphic files with a size between 32KiB and 64KiB:<br>
	<code><br>
	%insert_gfx_big(filename,id)<br>
	</code><br><br>

	<h3><a id="#BasicCode">Basic code for Player ExGFX change</a></h3><br>
	Now that you included your own custom graphics, it's time to make use of them.<br><br>
	Change Mario GFX:<br><br>
	<code>
	&emsp;&emsp;LDA #$01<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;STA !gfx_bypass_flag<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;LDA #$XX&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;;There goes the ID of your graphic file.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp;STA !gfx_bypass_num<br>
	</code><br>
	The code is rather simple, with a bit of work you can have a whole new set of different suits for Mario!<br><br>
